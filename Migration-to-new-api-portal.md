# Migration guide

Migration guide from the old api portal (https://api.kb.cz) to the new api portal (https://developers.kb.cz).

## General changes
- Api key header is now mandatory and renamed from `x-api-key` to `apiKey`.
- Each api now has its own apiKey. They cannot be reused between different API's. Generate new apiKeys in the API portal and replace them in your app.
- Always fill the `apiKey` header without the "Bearer" prefix.
